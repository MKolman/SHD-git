## What is git?

Git is code versioning system. There are many git hosting services available: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Visual Studio Team Services,...

With git you can have your code safely on a remote server, ready to be accessed by whomever you grant access. With the proper use of git all previous versions of your documents are saved and available.
